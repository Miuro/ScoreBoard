--------------------
Scoreboard consists of player objects with a name and points. At the moment players can also be created with just a name as well. Players can be sorted according to their points to ascending or descending order. Their points can also be set but this is still just a method for the player object.
  Scoreboard is written to a binary file named players.dat. At first run there will be an error and the file will be created if not yet existing.
